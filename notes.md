Pick an Editor
--------------
Pick an editor that's goot at processing JS code. Popular ones that are free or low cost are Webstorm, Atom, Bracket, and VSCode.


Setting Up .editorconfig
------------------------
An editor config file allows you to maintain consistency among projects and team members' developing styles by creating a baseline file to specify basic settings, like tabs vs spaces, indent size, linefeeds, charsets, and trailing whitespace. It's supported by some editors directly, and by many others via a plugin.

All you have to do is create a file called '.editorconfig' with the settings you want and save it in the root of your project.

Package management
------------------
Select a package manager to easily pull in the dependencies needed for your projects.
